Allow explicit config directory and honour XDG Base Dirs Spec

Resolve Issue #462 - "Tmuxinator config files in a different location"
Resolve Issue #360 - "XDG base directory support"
Mentioned in Issue #427 - "Introduce Analytics Module"

Allow `$TMUXINATOR_CONFIG` to specify a configuration directory, which
will be created if it doesn't exist.  This directory takes preference
over honouring the XDG specification (below). If specified, this will be
the only configuration location used.

Honour the [XDG Base Directories Specification]
(https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/) with
regards to user specific configuration files: Look for `tmuxinator`
configuration files under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmuxinator`.

For existing setups with no `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory, continue to
create new projects in `~/.tmuxinator` for backwards compatibility.

If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmuxinator exists, create new projects there.

If neither `~/.tmuxinator` nor `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmuxinator` exist, use
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmuxinator` for new projects.

When loading a project, search `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmuxinator` before
`~/.tmuxinator`.  Document in comments and tests the existing behaviour
of returning only the first project file found in a recursive search of
a configuration directory.

Add Config#directories: an array of the configuration director{y,ies}
which exist. Update commands `implode` and `list` to operate upon this
array.

Add `alias`es for the 3 renamed methods below for backward
compatibility:

Rename 'Config#root' -> 'Config#directory'
This directory is the only one used when creating new project files, and
may be either `$TMUXINATOR_CONFIG`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmuxinator` or
`~/.tmuxinator`.

Implementing XDG Base Dirs support with backwards compatibility means
that two directories may contain project files, making the `root`
nomenclature misleading as it implies a single directory.

Rename `Config#project_in_root` -> `Config#global_project`
See comment on `root` terminology above.  `global_project` is also
shorter and corresponds to the naming of `default_project`

Rename `Config#project_in_local` -> `Config#local_project`
Fit with the naming of both `global_project` and `default_project`
